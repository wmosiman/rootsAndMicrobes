# Root traits and microbes
Created: 2025-01-17 by Wyatt Mosiman

## Description
This repository was created to store files and work related to the population root microbiome project (a project of many names) led by Dr. Alicia Foxx. It was originally made by Wyatt Mosiman for building a semi-automated data extraction pipeline via LLMs, but could be expanded for use with other aspects of the project.
