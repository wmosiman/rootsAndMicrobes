When you encounter a superscript or a subscript, place all text that is super or subscripted into brackets and include a "^" (superscript) or "_" (subscript) before the brackets. Be certain you always include the caret ^ or the underscore _ before the text in brackets. Omitting this leads to confusion about whether the text is subscripted or superscripted. The brackets are very important because they identify the extent of the text in the super or subscript, so these must always be included also.

Examples: 
2Â² becomes 2^[2], 
ml^-1 becomes ml^[-1], 
Jane Doe^1,3 becomes Jane Doe^[1,3],
d_200 becomes d_[200], 
cm^-2 becomes cm^[-2], 
^1 University becomes ^[1] University
W_dry becomes W_[dry]. 

Pay particular attention to units with negative superscripts, such as ml^-1, cm^-2, and s^-3. Always format these correctly as ml^[-1], cm^[-2], and s^[-3], with the negative sign included.

# The position of images in relation to text this pdf is very important. In the text, indicate that an image was at a certain position by inserting the text "img_p[page number]_[# image on page]" at that position. For example, at the position of the first image on the second page of a document, you would write "img_p2_1". Knowing exactly where each image is located in the body of text is essential, so performing this task accurately is key.
